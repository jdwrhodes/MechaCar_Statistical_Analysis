## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

- In this analysis, the vehicle_length and ground_clearance provided a p-value of 2.60e-12 and 5.21e-08 respectively. This indicates that those variables provided a non-random amount of variance to the dataset.
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
- 
- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

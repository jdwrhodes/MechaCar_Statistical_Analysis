## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The picture below shows the results of a multi-linear regression analysis for the variables impacting the mpg of multiple vehicle prototypes.

- In this analysis, the vehicle_length and ground_clearance provided a p-value of 2.60e-12 and 5.21e-08 respectively. As they are both less than 0.05, this indicates that those variables provided a non-random amount of variance to the dataset. 
- The final p-value of 5.35e-11 is below the 0.05 threshhold, meaning we can reject the null-hypothesis that the slope is zero.
- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
